# hello-world

Florance and the machines has a wonderful music. It makes my mood a little higher(now is playing - "What The Water Gave To").

Today I've paid for the courses on html academy. I have to learn as much as I can for the sake of getting a job in Viseven company. I wish I'v had more time for my studies, but only five days left before the competition starts and I still haven't learned JavaScript. And there are a lot of other things I don't know... For example: how to use GitLab, FlexBox in css, JavaScript frameworks, etc. I feel like I am really a stupid person who can't learn this type of information and I push myself more harder to the point where my brain feels like its jelly, and my head become really heavy. Sometimes I even couldn't sleep because of that, but it's not the time to pity myself. 
Have to get back to work. Be strong, me.
